# Warehouse Operations Application

A full-stack warehouse management system for fragrance and cosmetics manufacturing and packaging companies. It covers inbound receiving, inventory, production, quality control, order-to-cash fulfillment, dispatch, delivery, and invoicing — with role-based access control (RBAC) across every module.

## Quick Start

You need **two terminals** running at the same time.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Terminal 1 — Backend (start first)

```bash
cd warehouse-app/backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Wait for: `Warehouse API running on http://localhost:3001`

Health check: http://localhost:3001/api/health → `{"status":"ok",...}`

On first run, the database is created, schema initialized, and demo data seeded automatically.

### Terminal 2 — Frontend

```bash
cd warehouse-app/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Wait for: `Local: http://localhost:3000`

**Open the app:** http://localhost:3000

### Environment

Backend config lives in `backend/.env` (included for local dev):

```env
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=warehouse-jwt-secret-change-in-production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=8h

# Local SQLite (default — omit DATABASE_URL)
DATABASE_PATH=./data/warehouse.db

# Neon Postgres — when set, SQLite is skipped (use pooled connection string)
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASS@ep-xxx-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/warehouse?sslmode=require
```

### Neon Postgres (cloud)

1. Create a [Neon](https://neon.tech) project and database named `warehouse`
2. Copy the **pooled** connection string from the Neon dashboard
3. Add to `backend/.env`:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...@ep-xxx-pooler.neon.tech/warehouse?sslmode=require
   ```
4. Start the backend — schema and demo data are created automatically on first run
5. Health check reports the active driver: `GET /api/health` → `"database": "postgres"`

**Local vs cloud:** If `DATABASE_URL` is set, Postgres is used. If unset, SQLite file at `DATABASE_PATH` is used. Same codebase, no frontend changes.

```bash
# Optional: Drizzle Kit migrations
cd warehouse-app/backend
npm run db:generate   # generate migration from schema.ts
npm run db:push       # push schema (dev)
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `EADDRINUSE` on 3001 | Port in use. Run `lsof -ti:3001 \| xargs kill -9`, then restart backend |
| `EADDRINUSE` on 3000 | Run `lsof -ti:3000 \| xargs kill -9`, then restart frontend |
| Login fails / API errors | Start the backend first (Terminal 1) |
| Missing menu items after upgrade | Restart backend, sign out, sign in again (permissions sync on startup) |
| Page won't load | Run `npm install` in both `backend` and `frontend` |

---

## Demo Accounts

All demo accounts use password: **`password123`**

The login page includes quick-fill buttons for each account.

| Email | Role |
|-------|------|
| admin@demo.com | Admin |
| manager@demo.com | Warehouse Manager |
| receiver@demo.com | Receiver |
| worker@demo.com | Warehouse Worker |
| production@demo.com | Production User |
| qc@demo.com | QC User |
| shipping@demo.com | Shipping User |
| sales@demo.com | Sales |
| driver@demo.com | Driver |
| viewer@demo.com | Viewer |

**Settings** (profile, change password) is available to every logged-in user via the top bar.

---

## Order-to-Cash Walkthrough

End-to-end flow for shops and distributors:

```
Receiving → Inventory → Customer order → Pick/Pack → Dispatch → Delivery → Invoice
```

| Step | Where | Suggested login |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1. Purchase order (optional) | Operations → Purchase orders | manager@demo.com |
| 2. Receive stock | Operations → Receiving | receiver@demo.com |
| 3. QC pass finished goods | Operations → Quality | qc@demo.com |
| 4. Create customer & order | Fulfillment → Customers, Orders | sales@demo.com |
| 5. Pick & pack | Fulfillment → Warehouse tasks | worker@demo.com |
| 6. Dispatch to driver | Fulfillment → Dispatch | manager@demo.com or shipping@demo.com |
| 7. Complete delivery | Fulfillment → Deliveries | driver@demo.com |
| 8. View invoice & notifications | Fulfillment → Invoices, Notifications | sales@demo.com |

**Inventory tip:** Only **QC PASSED** stock counts as available for orders. The Inventory page shows on-hand, reserved, and available-for-orders separately.

**Pick tip:** Scan the exact pallet code shown on the pick list (e.g. `PLT-0006`, not `PLT-006`).

---

## Roles & RBAC

### How it works

1. **Permissions** — Granular codes such as `orders.write`, `fulfillment.pick`, `qc.write`
2. **Roles** — Job functions that bundle permissions (Receiver, Sales, Driver, etc.)
3. **Users** — Assigned one or more roles

**Backend:** `authenticate` → `requirePermission(...)` → `blockViewerWrite` on every protected route.

**Frontend:** Sidebar filtered by permission; routes guarded by `ProtectedRoute`; write buttons hidden for Viewer.

### Sidebar visibility by role

                     Pass/Fail/Hold         Dispatch → Deliver
```

### Business rules

- Only **QC PASSED** finished goods are available for customer orders
- Inventory cannot go negative
- Pallet moves and picks create inventory transactions
- Important actions are recorded in the audit trail
- Viewer role is strictly read-only (frontend + backend)
- Warehouse workers cannot approve inventory adjustments

## API Overview

Base URL: `http://localhost:3001/api`

| Group | Endpoints |
|-------|-----------|
| **Auth** | `POST /auth/login`, `GET /auth/me`, `PUT /auth/change-password` |
| **Users & roles** | `/users`, `/roles`, `/invitations` |
| **Catalog** | `/products`, `/lots`, `/pallets`, `/locations` |
| **Inbound** | `/receiving`, `/purchase-orders` |
| **Production & QC** | `/production-orders`, `/qc` |
| **Inventory** | `/inventory`, `/inventory-transactions` |
| **Fulfillment** | `/customers`, `/orders`, `/fulfillment`, `/pick-lists`, `/packages` |
| **Outbound** | `/dispatch`, `/drivers`, `/deliveries`, `/proof-of-delivery`, `/shipments` |
| **Billing** | `/invoices`, `/notifications` |
| **Admin** | `/dashboard`, `/audit-logs`, `/organization` |
| **Health** | `GET /health` |

All routes except `/auth/login`, `/health`, and invitation accept require a valid JWT.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
cd warehouse-app/backend
npm test
```

Tests cover business rules, fulfillment logic, and pick-time inventory deduction.

---

## Resetting Demo Data

Delete the database and restart the backend:

```bash
rm warehouse-app/backend/data/warehouse.db
cd warehouse-app/backend && npm run dev
```

Schema and seed data are recreated on startup.

---

## Production Notes

- Set a strong random `JWT_SECRET` (required when `NODE_ENV=production`)
- Use **Neon Postgres** in production: set `DATABASE_URL` to the pooled connection string
- Use environment variables for all secrets — never commit real credentials
- Enable HTTPS and configure `CORS_ORIGIN` to your frontend domain
- Add rate limiting on authentication endpoints
